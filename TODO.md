# xdd TODO

**Current Phase**: Phase 0 Has Critical Issues ‚Üí Phase 1 Partially Complete
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01
**Validation Status**: Comprehensive validation performed with skeptical sub-agents

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES - MUST FIX BEFORE PROCEEDING

### Validation Results (2025-10-01)
After thorough validation with skeptical sub-agents:

**Phase 0 Core Utilities - CRITICAL FAILURES:**
1. **FileLock Race Conditions** - Mutual exclusion FAILS under concurrent load
   - Evidence: Integration tests show lost increments (49 instead of 50)
   - Root Cause: TOCTOU race between mkdir() and metadata write
   - Fix: Replace with proper OS-level file locking (flock/fcntl)

2. **AtomicWriter Not Atomic** - 124 corrupted writes detected
   - Evidence: Integration tests show data corruption
   - Root Cause: Missing parent directory fsync after rename
   - Fix: Add parent dir fsync for true durability

3. **Integration Tests Failing** - Tests timeout/hang after 2 minutes
   - Evidence: `bun test tests/integration/` hangs
   - Root Cause: Deadlocks or infinite loops in lock acquisition
   - Fix: Debug and resolve race conditions

**Phase 1 Schemas - MINOR ISSUES:**
1. ‚úÖ **Documentation Mismatch FIXED** - Updated all references from nanoid(10) to nanoid(16)
   - Fixed files: id-generator.ts, acceptance-criteria.ts, requirement.ts, changelog-events.ts, SPEC.md
   - Completed: 2025-10-01

### Production Readiness: 4/10
**NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE** - Critical race conditions and durability issues

## Before Starting Phase 1

### Critical (MUST DO)

**Status: 3/4 Complete**

1. ‚úÖ Update code comments - Remove false "all filesystems" claims
2. ‚úÖ Add filesystem warnings - Detect and warn about network filesystems
3. ‚úÖ Document limitations - README section on supported filesystems
4. ‚è±Ô∏è **Linux testing** - Validate on ext4/btrfs (2-3 hours estimated)

### Important (SHOULD DO)

1. [ ] Windows testing - Validate cross-platform (4-6 hours)
2. [ ] Longer stress test - 1-hour continuous operation
3. [ ] Add telemetry hooks - Prepare for production monitoring
4. [ ] Document recovery procedures - What to do if locks get stuck

### Optional (NICE TO HAVE)

1. [ ] Filesystem type detection
2. [ ] Automatic cleanup on startup
3. [ ] Lock health monitoring
4. [ ] Performance profiling under various loads

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Phase 0 Issues

**Status: No Blockers**

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Flaky test** (LOW priority)
   - Test: `atomic-writer-failure.test.ts`
   - Issue: Temp file cleanup timing (0.7% failure rate)
   - Impact: Minor, doesn't affect functionality
   - Fix: Add retry logic or timing adjustment

### Platform Limitations (DOCUMENTED)

1. **Network Filesystems** (HIGH priority for docs)
   - Issue: `mkdir()` not atomic on NFS/SMB/CIFS
   - Impact: Lock mechanism will fail silently
   - Status: DOCUMENTED, acceptable for target use case
   - Action: Add detection and warnings

2. **Platform Support** (MEDIUM priority)
   - macOS: ‚úÖ Validated
   - Linux: ‚è±Ô∏è Testing needed (2-3 hours)
   - Windows: ‚è±Ô∏è Testing needed (4-6 hours)

3. **PID Reuse** (LOW priority)
   - Issue: Lock ownership based on PID only
   - Impact: Theoretical lock hijacking (very low probability)
   - Status: ACCEPTABLE RISK

4. **Metadata Race Window** (LOW priority)
   - Issue: Small window between mkdir and metadata write
   - Impact: Mitigated by 1-second grace period
   - Status: ACCEPTABLE RISK

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items

1. **Claude SDK Changes** (HIGH)
   - Risk: Breaking changes in Anthropic SDK
   - Mitigation: Pin version, abstract interface
   - Action: Monitor changelogs, prepare for migration

2. **File System Operations** (MEDIUM)
   - Risk: Cross-platform compatibility issues
   - Mitigation: Test on Mac, Linux, Windows
   - Action: Linux testing (2-3 hours) required

3. **Concurrent Access** (LOW)
   - Risk: Edge cases in lock mechanism
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive multi-process tests
   - Status: ‚úÖ 100% success in testing

4. **YAML Corruption** (LOW)
   - Risk: Invalid YAML written
   - Mitigation: Validate before writing
   - Status: ‚úÖ Zod schemas + atomic writes

5. **Memory Usage** (LOW)
   - Risk: Large specifications cause OOM
   - Mitigation: Streaming for large files
   - Action: Test with 1000+ requirements

### Contingency Plans

- **If Claude SDK breaks**: Fallback to HTTP API directly
- **If file locking fails**: Use lock directories (already implemented)
- **If YAML becomes bottleneck**: Migrate to SQLite
- **If performance degrades**: Implement caching layer
- **If snapshots grow large**: Implement incremental snapshots

## Notes

### What Changed in V2

Phase 0 is complete, but Phase 1+ needs to be built:

**Removed from V1 (agent-sdd)**:
- Self-referential dogfooding approach
- Fictional `@agent-sdk` dependency
- Hash-based IDs (collision risk)
- Direct YAML writes (corruption risk)

**Added in V2 (xdd)**:
- Real Anthropic SDK integration
- nanoid for collision-resistant IDs
- Atomic write operations
- File-based locks
- Event sourcing with snapshots
- Phase 0 foundation (COMPLETE)

### Bootstrap Strategy

**Do NOT attempt self-referential development**.

The correct approach:
1. ‚úÖ Phase 0: Build foundation utilities (COMPLETE)
2. ‚è±Ô∏è Phase 1: Implement basic YAML operations (NEXT)
3. ‚è±Ô∏è Phase 2: Add LLM integration
4. ‚è±Ô∏è Phase 3: Build CLI
5. ‚è±Ô∏è Then: Use xdd for future xdd features

### Confidence Levels (After Validation)

- **Phase 0**: 3/10 (Red) - CRITICAL ISSUES - Race conditions and atomicity failures ‚ùå
- **Phase 1 Schemas**: 7/10 (Green) - Functionally complete, minor doc issues ‚úÖ
- **Phase 1 Changelog**: 0/10 - Not started
- **Phase 2**: 0/10 - Not started
- **Phase 3**: 0/10 - Not started

**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Must fix Phase 0 critical issues before proceeding. Phase 1 schemas are complete but Phase 0 foundation is broken.
