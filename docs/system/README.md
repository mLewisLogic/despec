# Despec System Documentation

**Status**: Phase 0 Complete
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30

## What's Actually Built (Phase 0)

Despec Phase 0 delivers the foundational infrastructure required for safe, concurrent file operations in a specification-driven development system.

### Core Infrastructure

Phase 0 provides four critical utility classes:

1. **AtomicWriter** - Write-rename pattern for atomic file operations
2. **FileLock** - Advisory locks using atomic lock directories
3. **InputValidator** - Comprehensive input sanitization
4. **ErrorHandler** - Exponential backoff with jitter

### Production Status

**Confidence Level**: 6/10 (Yellow - Proceed with caution)

- ✅ All critical functionality implemented
- ✅ 138 tests passing (73 unit, 62 integration, 3 multi-process)
- ✅ Zero data loss in real multi-process testing
- ✅ Suitable for local filesystem usage
- ⚠️ Network filesystem limitations documented
- ⚠️ Only tested on macOS (Linux testing pending)

## What's Planned (Phase 1+)

### Phase 1: Specs Stage (Not Started)

Natural language requirement processing system with:
- Zod-validated schemas for specifications
- EARS-formatted requirements
- Event-sourced changelog
- Anthropic SDK integration

### Phase 2: Design Stage (Not Started)

Component discovery and technical design:
- Component boundary analysis
- Technology research framework
- Decision recording system

### Phase 3: Tasks Stage (Not Started)

Task generation with TDD enforcement:
- Task generation from design
- Priority assignment
- Validation framework

## Documentation Structure

- **[phase-0-foundation.md](./phase-0-foundation.md)** - Complete Phase 0 implementation details
- **[testing-infrastructure.md](./testing-infrastructure.md)** - Test suite and CI/CD setup
- **[validation-report.md](./validation-report.md)** - Final validation and confidence assessment

## Quick Start

### For Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run tests during development
bun run test:watch

# Before committing
bun run check

# Full validation
bun run test:full
```

### For CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs on every push:
- Linting and type checking
- Unit and integration tests
- Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS)
- Coverage reporting

## Key Decisions

### Implemented (Phase 0)

1. ✅ Atomic lock directories (not lock files) - Eliminates TOCTOU races
2. ✅ Write-rename pattern for atomic operations
3. ✅ nanoid for collision-resistant IDs
4. ✅ Exponential backoff with jitter
5. ✅ Best-effort atomicity (suitable for single-agent use)

### Pending (Phase 1)

1. ⏳ Anthropic SDK integration
2. ⏳ Zod schema validation
3. ⏳ Event sourcing with snapshots
4. ⏳ YAML serialization
5. ⏳ CLI interface

## Known Limitations

### Phase 0 Infrastructure

1. **Network Filesystems**: `mkdir()` atomicity not guaranteed on NFS/SMB
2. **Platform Testing**: Only validated on macOS (Linux/Windows pending)
3. **PID Reuse**: Theoretical lock hijacking via PID reuse (very low probability)
4. **Metadata Race Window**: 1-second grace period for metadata writes

### Acceptable For

- ✅ Local filesystem development
- ✅ Solo developers and small teams
- ✅ Internal tools on known infrastructure
- ✅ Development and testing environments

### Not Suitable For (without additional work)

- ❌ Network-mounted home directories
- ❌ Distributed systems with NFS/SMB
- ❌ High-reliability mission-critical systems
- ❌ Systems requiring formal correctness proofs

## Next Steps

### Before Phase 1

**MUST DO**:
1. ⏱️ Linux testing (ext4/btrfs) - 2-3 hours
2. ✅ Update code comments (remove false "all filesystems" claims)
3. ✅ Add filesystem warnings
4. ✅ Document limitations

**SHOULD DO**:
1. Windows testing - 4-6 hours
2. Longer stress tests (1+ hour)
3. Add telemetry hooks
4. Document recovery procedures

### Phase 1 Readiness

Phase 1 can begin once:
- ✅ All Phase 0 tests passing
- ✅ Known limitations documented
- ⏱️ Linux testing complete
- ✅ Team acknowledges constraints

**Current Status**: 3/4 MUST DO items complete

## Performance Metrics
