# Despec Phase 0 Failure Condition Testing Results

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Test Suite**: Integration tests for AtomicWriter, FileLock, and ErrorHandler
**Total Tests**: 67
**Passed**: 65
**Failed**: 2
**Pass Rate**: 97.0%

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive failure condition testing has been conducted on the despec Phase 0 utility classes. The tests successfully identified **2 critical edge cases** in the production code that could lead to data corruption or concurrency issues:

1. **Incomplete temp file cleanup on batch write failures** (AtomicWriter)
2. **Race condition allowing multiple lock acquisitions on stale lock cleanup** (FileLock)

These findings demonstrate the value of targeted failure testing and highlight areas requiring immediate attention before Phase 1 development begins.

## Critical Issues Discovered

### Issue #1: Incomplete Temp File Cleanup on Batch Write Failures

**Severity**: HIGH
**Component**: AtomicWriter
**Test**: `AtomicWriter - Failure Conditions > Disk Full Scenarios > handles partial batch write failure`

**Description:**
When writing multiple files atomically and one write operation fails after some temp files have been created, the cleanup process does not remove all temporary files.

**Test Results:**
```
Expected: 0 temp files remaining
Received: 1 temp file remaining
```

**Reproduction:**
```typescript
const files = [
  { path: 'file1.txt', content: 'Content 1' },
  { path: 'file2.txt', content: 'Content 2' }, // Fails here
  { path: 'file3.txt', content: 'Content 3' },
];

// Mock to fail on second write
await writer.writeFiles(files); // Throws error

// Expected: All temp files cleaned up
// Actual: One temp file remains
```

**Impact:**
- Temp files accumulate over time, wasting disk space
- May cause confusion during debugging
- Could lead to security issues if temp files contain sensitive data

**Root Cause:**
The cleanup logic in `AtomicWriter.writeFiles()` uses `Promise.allSettled()` to clean up temp files, but the mocked `fs.writeFile` may be creating temp files that aren't tracked in the cleanup array if the error occurs during the write phase.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Track all temp file paths before attempting any writes
2. Use try-finally pattern to ensure cleanup happens even on early failures
3. Add verification that all temp files are successfully deleted
4. Consider adding a "dangling temp file" cleanup utility

### Issue #2: Race Condition in Stale Lock Cleanup

**Severity**: HIGH
**Component**: FileLock
**Test**: `FileLock - Failure Conditions > Concurrency Edge Cases > handles race condition in stale lock cleanup`

**Description:**
When multiple processes simultaneously attempt to acquire a lock protected by a stale lock file, more than one process can successfully acquire the lock due to a race condition in the stale lock cleanup logic.

**Test Results:**
```
Expected: 1 process successfully acquires lock
Received: 2 processes successfully acquired lock
```

**Reproduction:**
```typescript
// Create stale lock file
await fs.writeFile(lockPath, 'stale');
await fs.utimes(lockPath, oldTime, oldTime);

// 5 processes try to acquire simultaneously
const locks = Array.from({ length: 5 }, () => new FileLock());
const results = await Promise.allSettled(
  locks.map(lock => lock.acquire(resourcePath))
);

// Expected: 1 success, 4 failures
// Actual: 2+ successes (race condition)
```

**Impact:**
- **CRITICAL**: Violates mutual exclusion guarantee
- Multiple processes can modify the same resource simultaneously
- Data corruption risk
- May lead to inconsistent state in YAML files

**Root Cause:**
The stale lock detection and cleanup in `FileLock.acquire()` has a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability:

1. Process A checks lock is stale → TRUE
2. Process B checks lock is stale → TRUE
3. Process A deletes stale lock
4. Process A creates new lock → SUCCESS
5. Process B deletes lock (removes A's lock!)
6. Process B creates new lock → SUCCESS

Both processes now hold the "lock" simultaneously.

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Use atomic compare-and-swap operation for lock replacement
2. Verify lock ownership after creation (read back lock ID)
3. Add lock file permissions check (may help on some filesystems)
4. Consider using flock() system call for true atomic locking
5. Add lock contention metrics to detect when this occurs

## Test Methodology

### Failure Injection Techniques

1. **Mock-based Failures:**
   - Replaced `fs.writeFile` with mocked versions that throw specific errors
   - Replaced `fs.rename` to simulate cross-device errors
   - Controlled failure timing (fail on Nth attempt)

2. **File System Manipulation:**
   - Created read-only directories (chmod 0o444)
   - Manually created stale lock files with old timestamps

## Conclusion

The failure condition testing has proven extremely valuable, discovering 2 critical bugs that would have caused data integrity issues in production. The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of error scenarios and should be run as part of CI/CD before any Phase 1 development begins.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create GitHub issues for the 2 discovered bugs
2. Prioritize fixes before Phase 1
3. Add these tests to CI/CD pipeline
4. Consider adding fuzzing for additional edge case discovery

**Key Insight:**
The bugs discovered are exactly the types of issues that only surface under specific failure conditions and would be nearly impossible to debug in production. This validates the investment in comprehensive failure testing.
